Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
I am a student of Information Systems from UNESA and currently work as a backend developer intern at the GFT Group. I am passionate about developing my skills as a backend developer, with a solid foundation in various technologies and approaches, and I am ready to tackle any challenge.

My experience includes working with languages such as C#, Java, Javascript as well frameworks such as SpringBoot, .NET, and Angular. I am proficient in using tools like Docker, RabbitMQ, and have knowledge in architecture patterns such as microservices, MVC, CQRS.

In addition to my backend skills, I also have experience with front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Angular, and CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and TailwindCSS. I have experience with unit testing using XUnit and JUnit.

My database knowledge includes SQLServer, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis, and I have experience working in cloud environments such as Azure.
